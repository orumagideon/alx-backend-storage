Redis Cache Exercise
This repository contains Python code for implementing various functionalities using Redis as a caching mechanism. The exercises include storing and retrieving strings, incrementing values, storing and retrieving lists, and implementing an expiring web cache and tracker.

Instructions
Each exercise is implemented in a separate file within the 0x02-redis_basic directory.

Exercise 0: Writing strings to Redis
In this exercise, a Cache class is created with methods to store data in Redis and retrieve it using randomly generated keys.

Exercise 1: Reading from Redis and recovering original type
This exercise focuses on implementing a get method to retrieve data from Redis and converting it back to the original format, along with specific methods to retrieve strings and integers.

Exercise 2: Incrementing values
Here, a decorator count_calls is defined to count the number of times a method of the Cache class is called.

Exercise 3: Storing lists
The call_history decorator is implemented to store the history of inputs and outputs for a particular function.

Exercise 4: Retrieving lists
This task involves implementing a replay function to display the history of calls of a particular function.

Exercise 5: Implementing an expiring web cache and tracker
An advanced exercise where a get_page function is implemented to fetch HTML content from a URL, track the number of accesses, and cache the result with an expiration time of 10 seconds.

Repository Structure
0x02-redis_basic/
exercise.py: Contains implementations of the exercises.
web.py: File for implementing an expiring web cache and tracker.
main.py: Example usage of the implemented functionalities.
Usage
You can run the main.py file to see examples of each implemented functionality.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
Redis
redis package for Python
Running the Code
Make sure you have a Redis server running locally, and install the necessary Python packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install redis requests
Then, execute main.py:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Notes
Ensure the Redis server is running before executing the code.
For Exercise 5, the requests module is required to fetch web pages.
